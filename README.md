# Totify
Notification library for browser.

## Why?
- We don't need to use a library for specific frameworks only for notifications.
- This package is works on browser without any setup. Just add script to your HTML file and done.
- The package itself is also lightweight. And totify doesn't need a setup. Importing is enough.
- I always try to keep usage simple as possible.
- Notifications are customizable, Edit `#TOTIFY_NOTIFICATIONS` (eg. `#TOTIFY_NOTIFICATIONS div`) container with CSS.
